- License: Apache License 2

## Description / Features
This plugin for [SonarQube](http://www.sonarsource.com/) can be used to check the conformance of your code base to a 
formal architecture definition created with [Sonargraph](https://www.hello2morrow.com/products/sonargraph/architect9) version 8.7 and higher. 
A free license is available to allow you to check and measure the overall coupling and the level of cyclic dependencies at the package level. 
This license can be requested on the website of [Sonargraph Explorer](https://www.hello2morrow.com/products/sonargraph/explorer).
Usually a high level of coupling and cyclic dependencies points to a high level of 
structural erosion. If structural erosion grows over a certain level this will have a negative impact on testability, maintainability and 
comprehensibility of your code.
